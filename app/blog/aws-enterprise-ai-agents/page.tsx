        <h1 className="text-4xl font-bold text-gray-900 mb-6">Deploying AI Agents at Enterprise Scale with AWS</h1>
        
        <p className="text-xl text-gray-600 mb-8">
          As organizations increasingly adopt AI agents to drive business value, the challenge shifts from building 
          prototypes to deploying production-grade solutions at scale. AWS provides a robust ecosystem for developing, 
          deploying, and managing AI agents that can transform enterprise operations.
        </p>

        <h2>The AWS AI/ML Stack for Agent Development</h2>
        <p>
          AWS offers a comprehensive suite of services that form the foundation for building sophisticated AI agents:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Amazon Bedrock:</strong> Foundation models as a service for building generative AI applications</li>
          <li><strong>AWS AgentCore:</strong> Managed service for deploying and scaling AI agents</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon SageMaker:</strong> End-to-end machine learning service for building, training, and deploying models</li>
          <li><strong>AWS Step Functions:</strong> For orchestrating complex agent workflows</li>
          <li><strong>Amazon Kendra:</strong> Intelligent search service for knowledge base integration</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Architecting for Scale</h2>
        <p>
          Building enterprise-grade AI agents requires careful consideration of several architectural components:
        </p>

        <h3>1. Multi-Agent Systems</h3>
        <p>
          Complex business processes often require multiple specialized agents working in concert. AWS Step Functions 
          can coordinate these interactions, while Amazon EventBridge handles event-driven communication between agents.
        </p>

        <h3>2. Knowledge Integration</h3>
        <p>
          Effective agents require access to organizational knowledge. Amazon Kendra provides intelligent search 
          capabilities, while Amazon OpenSearch enables semantic search across documents and databases.
        </p>

        <h3>3. Security and Compliance</h3>
        <p>
          Enterprise deployments demand robust security measures:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>AWS KMS for encryption of data at rest and in transit</li>
          <li>AWS IAM for fine-grained access control</li>
          <li>AWS PrivateLink for secure VPC connectivity</li>
          <li>AWS Audit Manager for compliance reporting</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Operationalizing AI Agents</h2>
        <p>
          Moving from prototype to production requires addressing several operational concerns:
        </p>

        <h3>Monitoring and Observability</h3>
        <p>
          Amazon CloudWatch provides comprehensive monitoring for AI agents, while AWS X-Ray offers distributed tracing 
          to understand complex agent interactions. Custom metrics can track business-specific KPIs and agent performance.
        </p>

        <h3>Continuous Improvement</h3>
        <p>
          Implement feedback loops using Amazon SageMaker Model Monitor to track model drift and performance degradation. 
          Human-in-the-loop workflows with Amazon A2I ensure continuous improvement of agent capabilities.
        </p>

        <h2>Real-World Implementation: Customer Service Automation</h2>
        <p>
          A global financial services company implemented an AI agent system on AWS to handle customer inquiries. 
          The solution combined Amazon Lex for natural language understanding, Amazon Kendra for knowledge retrieval, 
          and AWS Lambda for business logic. The system reduced average handling time by 65% while maintaining 
          95%+ customer satisfaction scores.
        </p>

        <h2>Best Practices for Enterprise Deployment</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Start with well-defined use cases and success metrics</li>
          <li>Implement comprehensive testing and validation frameworks</li>
          <li>Design for failure and implement graceful degradation</li>
          <li>Establish clear governance and oversight processes</li>
          <li>Plan for ongoing maintenance and improvement</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Measuring Success</h2>
        <p>
          Key metrics for evaluating AI agent deployments include:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Task Completion Rate:</strong> Percentage of tasks successfully completed without human intervention</li>
          <li><strong>Resolution Time:</strong> Average time to resolve user requests</li>
          <li><strong>User Satisfaction:</strong> Direct feedback and satisfaction scores</li>
          <li><strong>Cost Savings:</strong> Reduction in operational costs compared to traditional approaches</li>
          <li><strong>Business Impact:</strong> Effect on key business metrics like sales, retention, or NPS</li>
        </ul>
